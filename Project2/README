Project description: Getting familiar with SDL Drawing and C++ class implementation. I drew a "Floating Island". I used the TriangleFill class and drawCircle function given in the examples to draw triangles and circles. I wrote a class to draw semi-circles which are used to draw the "clouds". I overloaded the output operator of the semi-circle class (i.e drawFillSemiCircle) to print the center and radius of the clouds. 

The easiest part of this project: Drawing the shapes by using their respective classes.

Problems that I had in completing this project: 1) I was not able to use the alpha channel to control the opacity. The renders were alwasy opaque irrespective of the alpha-channel value. 
												2) I was unable to initialize the co-ordinates in a 2D array.
