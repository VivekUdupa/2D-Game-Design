Project no: 5

Project due date: December 7th, 2018

Project description:
Foundation to a playable game that includes:
	-HUD
	-Object Pooling
	-Projectile
	-Explosions


Where I got my sprites: 

The background was taken from:
https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-halloween-2d-game-backgrounds/

The player sprite was taken from :
https://craftpix.net/freebies/2d-fantasy-knight-free-sprite-sheets/

What sprite did I create (not Sprite or MultiSprite):
Knight -> This is the player who can be controlled by a,s,d,w. 
ghosts -> these are smart sprites that has AI. 
Spear -> The projectile.

The easiest part of this project:
Implementing the HUD

Problems that I had in completing this project:
I do not know how to make the smart sprites explode when they collide with the projectile.

Light at the end of the tunnel: 
I want to design a game where the player must go through a series of obstacles/traps to reach the other end. 
The player( who is a knight currently ) has to escape through a haunted graveyard where zombies and gosts try to attack him. I want to include pit holes and some other traps which has to be avoided. The knight has to collect a key to unlock the door reaching which concludes the game.
