Project description:
This project included the implementation of inheritance and polymorphism, design patterns including factory and singleton, data-driven programming and a tracker framework.  
I drawing is called Space Adventures. 

Where I got my sprites: 
I drew the sprites using inkspace and GIMP. The following were used as references/inspirations. 
Astronaut:

UFO:

I DID NOT draw the backgrounds. The backgrounds were taken from the following sites:
Planets:

Space:

How many backgrounds do I have: I have 3 backgrounds.
1) Background starry Space (spaceBG.png)
2) Big planets (planetsBig.png)
3) Small planets (planetsSmall.png)

What sprite did I create (not Sprite or MultiSprite):
I created 3 sprites: 
1) Rotating astronaut with 24 frames
2) UFO with 2 frames
3) Rocket with 6 frames. This is a two way multisprite where 3 frames go right and 3 go left. 

The easiest part of this project:
1) Converting the ranged for loops to while loops and vice versa. 

Problems that I had in completing this project:
1) I took some time to figure out how to print FPS.
2) Unclear on Singletons. I converted Gof to Mayers singleton by fixing one error at a time.
